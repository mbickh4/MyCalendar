# MyCalendar
I created this in VS Code. I suggest downloading it to run this App.
I used React and React Native libraries. In the future i will be using EXPO as well

However I regular CLI should work too.
STEPS to RUN:
1. Download VS Code
2. Download Node.js //this is a Javascript runtime enviroment
3. After that in the VS Code CLI type "npm install -g expo-cli" //this lets you run and test the app.
4. After that, clone my git repository.
5. Then check out this branch
6. After that in the CLI (make sure your in the right folder) type "npx expo start"
7. Hit "w" to pull up the app in the browser.
8. I will also have other emulaters on there (it'll let you which buttoms to press)
   
You can also download the EXPO Go app and run it from there.
1. In the CLI there will be a QR code that pops up and it'll let you view the app on you phone. (the layout on the browser and phone will look different)
