# MyCalendar
A calendar app to fullfill our CSC3380 project requirements.

Created in React Native using Expo, this allows us to easily make this Calender app cross-platform.

Planned features:
- Create events on your calender
- Login functionality
- Sync calender between devices using login functionality (backend database)

More features will probably be thought up of and will be implemented but for now we are sticking to these features.
